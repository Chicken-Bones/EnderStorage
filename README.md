EnderStorage
==============
THIS PROJECT IS RETIRED: See [here] for the current repo.

EnderStorage is a mod that offers a means to store your items in The END, causing them to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. All EnderStorage makes use of the magic of colors to link storage with its little piece of The END. Any EnderStorage with the same color code share inventory (even across dimensions). Currently there are three types of storage, EnderChest, EnderPouch, and EnderTank.

EnderChests are a stationary type of EnderStorage. You can use dye on the wool pads on top of the chest to alter its color code. As an alternative, you can craft an EnderChest with three dyes to change the color code as well. EnderChests work as any other chest for the purposes of blocks that manipulate chests contents. This makes EnderChests an ideal way to transport items over vast distances in an instant.

EnderPouches are a mobile type of EnderStorage. You can use an EnderPouch on any EnderChest to change the pouch color code to match that of the chest. EnderPouches access the same inventory as their EnderChest counterparts, allowing easy access to your base resources right from your inventory.

EnderTanks are a stationary type of EnderStorage. You can use dye on the wool pads on top of the tank to alter its color code. EnderTanks work as a tank to store liquids. Right clicking on the dial on the front will change it between input (blue) and output (orange) mode.
